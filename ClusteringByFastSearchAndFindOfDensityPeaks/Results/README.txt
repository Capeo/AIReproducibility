This folder contains the results from the reproduction attempt from "Clustering by fast search and find of density peaks" in csv files.

There are two formats used for the results. 

In Fig 3A, 3C, 3D, S6 and S7 the last column is the cluster, and the others are the coordinates.

In Olivetti the first row is the index of the point (1 indexed) and the second row is the cluster assignment.
