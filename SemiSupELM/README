This repository attempts to reproduce the results presented in:
Due to time constraints, only the semisupervised part has been implemented.

Usage:

example invocations:

python3 main.py coil20b idx_datasets/pregen/coil20b.json

or

python3 main_runall.py

* To run a particular experiment using a particular partition of the dataset into folds
  (labeled, unlabeled, validation, test), using k-fold crossvalidation:

  python3 main.py experiment_name path_to_json_folds

  Where experiment_name is one of :
    coil20, coil20b, g50c, uspst, uspstb

  And where path_to_json_fold is a path to a json file generated for a
  particular dataset, by e.g main_gendata.py

  (pregenerated ones used to produce the results in the results/ directory
   are provided in the directory idx_datasets/pregen/)

* To generate the json file with the folds to pass to e.g main.py:

  python3 main_gendata.py

  Remember to change the paths to the .mat datasets in main_gendata.py to
  the appropriate location where they are stored.

* To run all (semisupervised) experiments:

  python3 main_runall.py

The results will be stored in the results directory, with a timestamp on each file for when its
experiment was run so to not overwrite previous results.

Each model (experiment) in the results directory has two output files:
*A .summary file, which lists very summaric results from running the model
  on the test sets of that file

*A .csv file, where each row has the entries: index_in_dataset,predicted_label,target_label,fold_number

Description of entries:

* index_in_dataset is the row of the dataset that was classified
* predicted_label is the label the model predicted
* actual_label is the true label
* fold_number is which fold from k-cross validation the line corresponds to;
  this value can largely be ignored
