This repository attempts to reproduce the results presented in: 
 "Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Extreme Learning Machines"
  (See CITATION file for detailed citation)

Please be adviced before using this implementation as a reference that the 
error rates from running the implementation are very poor, and does not 
reach the values achieved in the cited paper. This indicates that there very
likely are errors in the implementation due do misinterpretations or ambiguities.

Due to time constraints, only the semisupervised part has been implemented.

Usage:

example invocations:

python3 main.py coil20b idx_datasets/pregen/coil20b.json

or

python3 main_runall.py

* To run a particular experiment using a particular partition of the dataset into folds
  (labeled, unlabeled, validation, test), using k-fold crossvalidation:

  python3 main.py experiment_name path_to_json_folds

  Where experiment_name is one of :
    coil20, coil20b, g50c, uspst, uspstb

  And where path_to_json_fold is a path to a json file generated for a
  particular dataset, by e.g main_gendata.py

  (pregenerated ones used to produce the results in the results/ directory
   are provided in the directory idx_datasets/pregen/)

* To generate the json file with the folds to pass to e.g main.py:

  python3 main_gendata.py

  Remember to change the paths to the .mat datasets in main_gendata.py to
  the appropriate location where they are stored.

* To run all (semisupervised) experiments:

  python3 main_runall.py

The results will be stored in the results directory, with a timestamp on each file for when its
experiment was run so to not overwrite previous results.

Each model (experiment) in the results directory has two output files:
*A .summary file, which lists very summaric results from running the model
  on the test sets of that file

*A .csv file, where each row has the entries: index_in_dataset,predicted_label,target_label,fold_number

Description of entries:

* index_in_dataset is the row of the dataset that was classified
* predicted_label is the label the model predicted
* actual_label is the true label
* fold_number is which fold from k-cross validation the line corresponds to;
  this value can largely be ignored
