These are the applied modifications and results from trying to replicate the
results in the cited paper (Deep Learning-Based Classification of Hyperspectral Data),
using the source code published by one of the authors of that paper.

Modifications applied here:
  * Training epochs correspond with paper (changed in repo commit)
    (only mentioned in the paper for one method, ksc_SdA, 3300 mentioned while
     paper sets it to 300. Pavia is set to a different number of epochs,
     without the paper mentioning this).
  * Configure Theano to use GPU
  * Fix paths
  * Fix an import
  * Stop matplotlib plot from being shown due to being run from tty
  * Fix numpy bug https://github.com/numpy/numpy/commit/6b1a1205eac6fe5d162f16155d500765e8bca53c


The tail of the program output as well as the files generated are included in
the raw_results directory. Additionally, ksc_SdA.py was run with
pretraining_epochs set to both 3300 and 300, the former because that is the
value in the paper and the latter because a commit to the repository changed
it to 300. The results from both runs are included in the directory.
