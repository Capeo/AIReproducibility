Concerning the concrete files contained in these directories, they are the
result of running main.py two times, once each on two different machines. 

The reason that two invocations are included is that the program by default
uses multiple cores, so the order of values from each invocation might vary,
but the means should still be identical, as indicated by running a diff on
the two tables (which only contain means, not values used to calculate the 
mean) in the directory miscellaneous_results.
