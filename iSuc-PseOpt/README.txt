This is a reimplementation of the method proposed in "iSuc-PseOpt: Identifying lysine succinylation sites in proteins by incorporating sequence-coupling effects into pseudo components and optimizing imbalanced training dataset" (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2015.12.009).
It was created with the purpose of reproducing the results reported in that paper.

The 'Code' folder contains the code produced during the reproduction attempt.

The 'Results' folder contains the results achieved from re-running the experiments.

'Experiment.txt' contains a summary of the data and experiment setup.
