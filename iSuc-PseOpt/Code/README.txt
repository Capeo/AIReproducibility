This is a reimplementation of the method proposed in "iSuc-PseOpt: Identifying lysine succinylation sites in proteins by incorporating sequence-coupling effects into pseudo components and optimizing imbalanced training dataset".
It was created with the purpose of reproducing the results reported in that paper.

To execute the reproduction attempt, run "Main.m". The first six lines of "Main.m" defines arguments for the reproduction attempt, and may need to be edited.

The Random Forest implementation was downloaded from https://code.google.com/archive/p/randomforest-matlab/
