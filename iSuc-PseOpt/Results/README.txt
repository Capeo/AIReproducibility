This folder contains results from reproduction attempts of "iSuc-PseOpt: Identifying lysine succinylation sites in proteins by incorporating sequence-coupling effects into pseudo components and optimizing imbalanced training dataset".

The reproduction attempts were carried out three times, with number of k-fold cross-validation folds equal to 6, 8, and 10. The folders K6, K8, and K10 contains the results from these three attempts.
Each of these folders contains another set of folders with one folder per fold.
For each fold we report the list of instances used in the training set (training.csv), and the instances used in the test set together with our predicted class (results.csv).
For the class labels 1 indicates a positive sample, and 0 a negative sample. The values are delimited with ';'.

NOTE:
The original dataset, retrieved from http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iSuc-PseOpt, did not include ids. The ids were generated by assigning ascending integer values to each instance based on their sequence in the retrieved dataset, starting with the positive instances.
The first id is 1.
