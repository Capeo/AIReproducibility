This is a reimplementation of the method proposed in "Measuring the Objectness of Image Windows" (https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2012.28).
It was created with the purpose of reproducing the results reported in that paper.

The 'Code' folder contains the experiment code written to run the experiments from the original article. It depends on the method code from the original experiment, which must be downloaded separately.
See 'Experiment.txt' for details on the method code.

The 'Results' folder contains the results achieved from re-running the experiments.

'Experiment.txt' contains a summary of the data and experiment setup.
