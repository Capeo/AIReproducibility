This folder contains experiment code that was written to recreate the experiments of "Measuring the Objectness of Image Windows".

The first 6 lines of the file 'Reproduction.m' defines method arguments, and may need to be changed.

The file 'Reproduction.m' is not runnable independently, and requires access to an implementation of the method 'runObjectness(image, nr_windows, params)', which is proposed in "Measuring the Objectness of Image Windows".
For our reproduction attempt, we used Objectness measure V2.2 downloaded from http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/calvin/objectness/
